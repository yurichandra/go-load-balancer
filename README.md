# Plan

I split this project into a roadmap and split the road map by section which I should work on.

### Roadmap
- I. Basic functionality
    [] Able to load balance the traffic to the backend server using round-robin algorithm & include its concurrency.
    [] Able to perform regular healthcheck to the backend server.
- II. Advanced functionality
    [] Able to configure the load balancer using multiple of algorithms option.
    [] Able to configure the load balancer using .yaml file.
